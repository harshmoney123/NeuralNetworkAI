# NeuralNetworkAI
This is a Basic AI that utilizes Neural Networks

This Neural Network aspect of this code was originally downloaded from Dave Miller's Neural Network tutorial

With this project I hope to create a generalized AI that can take in the vast amount of information that exists on the internet and find patterns. I have made some changes to the C++ files to allow the program to work with Xcode and OSX. 

I also hope that with this project I learn the inner workings of how Neural Networks and AIs work.
