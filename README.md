# NeuralNetworkAI
This is a Basic AI that utilizes Neural Networks and Genomic Algorithms 

This file was originally downloaded from Ai-junkie.com and will serve as the template for this AI.

With this project I hope to create a generalized AI that can take in the vast amount of information that exists on the internet and find patterns. I have made some changes to the C++ files to allow the program to work with Xcode and OSX. 

Problems that need to be resolved
-Program does not actually run because the time functionalities have been taken out (Due to time being a part of windows.h)


I also hope that with this project I learn the inner workings of how Neural Networks and AIs work.
